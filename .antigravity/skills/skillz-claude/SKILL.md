# Skillz-Claude (D-EPCT+R Workflow)

Structured development workflow for professional AI coding.

## Workflow: D-EPCT+R
1. **Discovery**: Brainstorm + Research -> PRD -> Archi -> Stories.
2. **Design**: UX Design -> UI Design.
3. **Development**: Explain -> Plan -> Code -> Test -> Review.

## Principles
- **Research First**: Always explore the codebase before planning or coding.
- **Validation Blocks**: Stop for user validation at key milestones (PRD, Plan).
- **Quality First**: Required lint, types, and test passing at each step.

## Subskills
- `idea-brainstorm`: Creative exploration.
- `pm-prd`: Product requirements.
- `architect`: Technical architecture.
- `pm-stories`: INVEST stories.
- `implementation-planner`: Step-by-step logic.
- `code-implementer`: Writing clean code with lint checks.
- `test-runner`: Automated testing.
- `code-reviewer`: 3-pass review system.
